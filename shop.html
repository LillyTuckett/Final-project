		<div class="FAQ">
				
				<h3 class="readmore one">How long does a spray tan last?</h3>
				
				<p id="show-this-on-click1" class='hidden'>Your Naked Tan spray tan will last between 7 to 10 days if maintained properly. The day of your spray tan, we recommend washing it off with Goddess Body Cleanser in order to avoid streaks, and moisturise with Goddess Crème de la Crème daily for a longer lasting tan.</p>
				<hr>

				<h3 class="readmore two">How to remove fake tan?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click2" class='hidden'>The best way to remove a fake tan is to prepare a hot bath, light up some candles, sit back and enjoy some ‘me time’. To ensure your old tan is removed entirely, we recommend you use Naked Tan Goddess Body Exfoliator all over your body with an exfoliating mitt. You are now ready for a fresh new tan.</p>

				</div>
				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore four">Why am I Patchy?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click4" class='hidden'>This can occur if the client hasn’t exfoliated properly prior to their tan, medications,pregnant, hormonal imbalance, pigmentation, has sweated or come into contact with liquid prior to washing off their tan, if the solution has reached its expiry date, if the technician has missed areas on the clients skin or over sprayed other areas.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore five">What should I do to prolong my tan?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click5" class='hidden'>Prepare the skin by exfoliating with Goddess Body Exfoliator prior to your Naked Tan spray tan, this will remove the body of dead skin cells. Apply Goddess Crème de la Crème daily or Goddess Gradual Tan to maintain constant colour in the skin. Avoid long hot baths, swimming, saunas, excessive sweating. Drink plenty of water to keep the skin hydrated. You should expect 7-10 days from a spray tan when maintained as per above. Expect 4-7days if none of the above is maintained.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore six">Can I shave/wax my legs/body parts before or after the tan application?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click6" class='hidden'>Advise clients to shave/wax at least 12 hours prior to their spray tan.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore seven">I have sensitive skin, can I still be sprayed?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click7" class='hidden'>If your client has eczema, dermatitis, or psoriasis it’s best to patch test the skin. If the skin has no reaction within 24hrs the spray tan may go ahead.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore eight">Can pregnant or breastfeeding women be sprayed?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click8" class='hidden'>Testing has shown that DHA does not penetrate the skin, nor enter the blood stream, therefore, it appears safe to spray pregnant women. As a precaution we suggest clients who are pregnant to get permission from their doctor. For women who are breastfeeding, inform that they should ensure their nipples are wiped over before breastfeeding.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore nine">Do I have to take all of my clothes off?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click9" class='hidden'>Absolutely not, a client should feel comfortable and can choose to wear their bathers, underwear, g-string or they can go naked if they prefer.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore ten">During my shower, I have noticed some colour washing away?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click10" class='hidden'>This is fine and completely normal. The excess colour that is washing away is just the bronzer.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore eleven">How often should I moisturise after being spray tanned?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click11" class='hidden'>The more the better! We advise moisturizing with Goddess Crème de la Crème once or twice a day. This will help your tan to fade evenly while keeping the skin well nourished.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore twelve">After being sprayed, do I still need to wear sunscreen?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click12" class='hidden'>Yes! Tanning solution does not contain sunscreen.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore thirteen">How often should I moisturise after being spray tanned?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click13" class='hidden'>The more the better! We advise moisturizing with Goddess Crème de la Crème once or twice a day. This will help your tan to fade evenly while keeping the skin well nourished.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore fourteen">Will tanning solution stain my clothes? What should I wear after my tanning session?</h3> 

				<p id="show-this-on-click14" class='hidden'>We suggest loose dark coloured cotton fabrics as the bronzer will wash out easily from cotton. We prefer females to go bra less if possible immediately after the spray tan to avoid the bra rubbing against the skin and removing the tan.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore fifteen">Can I wear make-up straight after my tan?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click15" class='hidden'>Wearing make-up is fine, however clients should not wash their face or apply make up or moisturiser prior to washing off your tan as water stops the development process. Makeup applied before the tanning session will act as a barrier so it is likely that the tan on their face will be slightly lighter than on the rest of their body.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore sixteen">I frequently go swimming, will this affect my tan?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click16" class='hidden'>Yes, swimming in chlorine water or salt water will cause the tan to fade in colour.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="readmore seventeen">Can I leave my Naked Tan on longer than 2 hrs?</h3>
					
				<p id="show-this-on-click17" class='hidden'>As Naked Tan is a TRUE 2hr tan, we recommend leaving your Naked Tan on for 2 hours (do not exceed 4 hours). Naked Tan is a concentrated solution and may over develop on the skin if left on for too long, this will cause the tan to look more golden/orange.</p>
